2. Tip.

Letâ€™s say we are going to a restaurant and we decide to leave a tip. We can create a function to easily calculate the
amount to tip based on the total cost of the food and a percentage. This function will accept both of those values as
inputs and return the amount of money to tip. In order to do this, we will need a few steps:

 - Define the function to accept the total cost of the food called total and the percentage to tip as percentage
 - Calculate the tip amount by multiplying the total and percentage and dividing by 100
 - Return the tip amount
"""


# Write your tip function here:

def tip(total, percentage):
    return (total * percentage) / 100


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(tip(10, 25))
# should print 2.5
print(tip(0, 100))
# should print 0.0
