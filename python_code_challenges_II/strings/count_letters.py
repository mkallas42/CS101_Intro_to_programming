1. Count Letters.

For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we
are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few
ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Here is
what we need to do:

 - Define the function to accept one parameter â€” the word whose letters we are counting
 - Create a counter to keep track of unique letters
 - Loop through every letter in our alphabet string. If the current letter was found in our word, increase our count
 - Return the count after looping through all letters.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"


# Write your unique_english_letters function here:
def unique_english_letters(word):
    uniques = 0
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in word:
            uniques += 1
    return uniques


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4
