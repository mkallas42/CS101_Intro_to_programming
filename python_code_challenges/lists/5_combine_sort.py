5. Combine Sort.

Finally, letâ€™s create a function that combines two different lists together and then sorts them. To do this we can
combine the lists with an operation and then sort using a function call. Here are the steps we need to use:

1. Define the function to accept two parameters, one for each list.
2. Combine the two lists together
3. Sort the result
4. Return the sorted and combined list
"""


# Write your function here

def combine_sort(lst1, lst2):
    combined_list = lst1 + lst2
    return sorted(combined_list)


# Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(combine_sort([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))
