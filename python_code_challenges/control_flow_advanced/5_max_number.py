5. Max Number.

For the final challenge, we are going to select which number from three input values is the greatest using conditional
statements. To do this, we need to check the different combinations of values to see which number is greater than the
other two. Here is what we need to do:

1. Define a function that has three input parameters, num1, num2, and num3
2. Test if num1 is greater than the other two numbers
    If so, return num1
3. Test if num2 is greater than the other two numbers
    If so, return num2
4. Test if num3 is greater than the other two numbers
    If so, return num3
5. If there was a tie between the two largest numbers, then return "It's a tie!"

# Write your max_num function here:

def max_num(num1, num2, num3):
    if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
        return num1
    elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
        return num2
    elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:
        return num3
    else:
        return "It's a tie!"


# Uncomment these function calls to test your max_num function:
print(max_num(-10, 0, 10))
# should print 10
print(max_num(-10, 5, -30))
# should print 5
print(max_num(-5, -10, -10))
# should print -5
print(max_num(2, 3, 3))
# should print "It's a tie!"
