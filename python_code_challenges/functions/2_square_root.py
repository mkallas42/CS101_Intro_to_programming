2. Square Root.

Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this using similar steps
from the last problem. The code will look very similar. We need to:

 - Set up the function header for square_root which accepts one parameter
 - Take the square root of the input value
 - Return the result
"""


# Write your square_root function here:

def square_root(num):
    return num ** 0.5


# Uncomment these function calls to test your square_root function:
print(square_root(16))
# should print 4
print(square_root(100))
# should print 10
