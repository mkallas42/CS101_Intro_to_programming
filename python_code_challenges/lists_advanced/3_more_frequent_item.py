3. More Frequent Item.

Letâ€™s go back to our factory example. We have a conveyor belt of items where each item is represented by a different
number. We want to know, out of two items, which one shows up more on our belt. To solve this, we can use a function
with three parameters. One parameter for the list of items, another for the first item we are comparing, and another
for the second item. Here are the steps:

1. Define the function to accept three parameters: the list, the first item, and the second item
2. Count the number of times item1 shows up in our list
3. Count the number of times item2 shows up in our list
4. If item1 shows up more, return item1. Otherwise, return item2
"""


# Write your function here

def more_frequent_item(lst, item1, item2):
    if lst.count(item1) >= lst.count(item2):
        return item1
    return item2


# Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))
