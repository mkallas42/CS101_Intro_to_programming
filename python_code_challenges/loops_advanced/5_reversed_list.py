5. Reversed List.

For the final challenge, we are going to test two lists to see if the second list is the reverse of the first list.
There are a few different ways to approach this, but we are going to try a method that iterates through each of the
values in one direction for the first list and compares them against the values starting from the other direction in
the second list. Here is what you need to do:

 - Define a function that has two input parameters for our lists
 - Loop through every index in one of the lists from beginning to end
 - Within the loop, compare the element in the first list at the current index against the element at the second
    list’s last index minus the current index. If there was a mismatch, then the lists aren’t reversed and we
    can return False
 - If the loop ended successfully, then we know the lists are reversed and we can return True.

# Write your function here

def reversed_list(lst1, lst2):
    for index in range(len(lst1)):
        if lst1[index] != lst2[len(lst2) - 1 - index]:
            return False
    return True


# Uncomment the lines below when your function is done
print(reversed_list([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]))
print(reversed_list([1, 5, 3], [3, 2, 1]))
