"""
1. First Three Multiples.

Letâ€™s start by creating a function which both prints and returns values. For this function, we are going to print out
the first three multiples of a number and return the third multiple. This means that we are going to print 1, 2, and
3 times the input number and then return the value of 3 times the input number. For this, we are going to need
a few steps:

 - Define the function header to accept one input parameter called num
 - Print out 1 times num
 - Print out 2 times num
 - Print out 3 times num
 - Return the value of 3 times num
"""


# Write your first_three_multiples function here

def first_three_multiples(num):
    print(1 * num)
    print(2 * num)
    print(3 * num)
    return 3 * num


# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
first_three_multiples(0)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
