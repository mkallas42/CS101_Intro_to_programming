3. Always False.

There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements.
One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass
into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. It will contain a few steps:

1. Define the function to accept a single parameter called num
2. Use a combination of <, > and and to create a contradiction in an if statement.
3. If the condition is true, return True, otherwise return False. The trick here is that because we’ve written a
contradiction, the condition should never be true, so we should expect to always return False.

# Write your always_false function here:

def always_false(num):
    if num <= num <= num:
        return False
    return True


# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False
