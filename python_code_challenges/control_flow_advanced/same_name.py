"""
2. Same Name.

We need to write a program that checks different names and determines if they are equal.
We need to accept two strings and compare them. Here are the steps:

1. Define the function to accept two strings, your_name and my_name
2. Test if the two strings are equal
3. Return True if they are equal, otherwise return False
"""


# Write your same_name function here:

def same_name(your_name, my_name):
    if your_name == my_name:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Uncomment these function calls to test your same_name function:
print(same_name("Colby", "Colby"))
# should print True

print(same_name("Tina", "Amber"))
# should print False
