3. Larger List.

Letâ€™s say we are working with two conveyor belts that contain items represented by a numerical ID. If one conveyor
belt contains more items than the other, then we need to return the ID of the last item on that belt. In the case
where they have the same number of items, return the last item from the first conveyor belt. In our code, we can
represent the belts using lists. Here are the steps:

1. Define the function to accept two parameters for our two lists of numbers
2. Check if the length of the first list is greater than or equal to the length of the second list
3. If true, then return the last element from the first list. Otherwise, return the last element from the second list

# Write your function here

    if len(lst1) >= len(lst2):
        return lst1[-1]
    return lst2[-1]


# Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5, ], [-10, 2, 5, 10, ]))
